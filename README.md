## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this application locally, please follow the instructions below.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ACHYUTAM2004/Music-genre-clasifier.git](https://github.com/ACHYUTAM2004/Music-genre-clasifier.git)
    cd Music-genre-clasifier
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Download the Pre-trained Model:**
    The model is hosted on Google Drive. Please [download the `Trained_model_final.h5` file from this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zH-zgsuZQU9jverJg5us5w_2YvCJOIO0/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the root directory of the project.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## üìù How to Use

1.  **Launch the App**: Run `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal or visit the [live Streamlit app](https://musicclasifier.streamlit.app/).
2.  **Navigate**: Use the sidebar to choose between "About App," "How it Works?," or "Predict Music Genre."
3.  **Upload Audio**: In the prediction section, select an `.mp3` or `.wav` file and upload it.
4.  **Predict Genre**: Click the "Know Genre" button to classify the audio. The app will display a pie chart with the genre predictions.

## üî¨ How It Works

This classifier leverages deep learning and digital signal processing to analyze audio and predict genres.

1.  **Audio Processing:** The uploaded audio file is divided into overlapping chunks to capture various sections of the song.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Each audio chunk is converted into a **Mel Spectrogram** using `torchaudio`. The spectrogram is resized to a (210, 210) format to match the input dimensions expected by the model.
3.  **Model Prediction**: The pre-trained TensorFlow model classifies each chunk into a genre. The final genre is determined by the most frequent prediction across all chunks.
4.  **Visualization**: A Plotly pie chart displays the genre distribution, with the primary genre highlighted.
